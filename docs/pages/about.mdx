# About

Since 2017, when TU Delft celebrated its 175th anniversary, the university has been raising the profile of its academic heritage by systematically curating its collections, initiating research projects and organising on-campus presentations in collaboration with students and academic staff. From this project a IIIF-based Exhibition Viewer was built to present on-campus pyshical Exhibitions in a digital format.

In 2024 work started on splitting out this Exhibition Viewer into it's own IIIF Viewer and adding the ability to customise it. Additionally improvements were made to the Digirati [IIIF Manifest Editor](https://manifest-editor.digirati.services) to support Exhibition Building.
