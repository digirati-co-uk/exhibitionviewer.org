        <p>
          This example from the <strong>Victoria & Albert Museum</strong>, using
          a IIIF manifest created 7 years ago, demonstrates the evolution of
          digital exhibition formats. This shows how the foundational concepts
          of interactive online exhibitions and has since been incorporated into
          this viewer - but remain interoperable thanks to IIIF.
