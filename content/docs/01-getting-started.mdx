# Getting started

## Some links and examples

To browse a range of exhibitions that use the Exhibition Viewer, the Exhibitions section of the [TU Delft Heritage website](https://heritage.tudelft.nl/en/exhibitions) has many examples.

Another example can be viewed from Leeds University, see the [Welcome to Yorkshire: The art of Marie Hartley exhibition](https://leedsunilibrary.exhibitionviewer.org/marie-hartley). You can also read a little bit about the creation of the exhibition on the [Leeds University Libraries blog](https://leedsunilibrary.wordpress.com/2025/05/30/first-iiif-digital-exhibition-as-iiif-goes-live-on-cultural-collections-website/).

A [digital exhibition building workshop](https://digirati-workshops.pages.dev/) was held in the Netherlands in March, and you can view the workshop website which provides detailed steps on getting started, exploring and finding IIIF content and creating exhibitions.

## Guides

We are developing guides to cover the following aspects of the Exhibition Viewer:

- Creating Exhibition Manifests using the Manifest Editor
- Sharing Exhibitions using the Exhibition Viewer site
- Creating a GitHub pages website with the IIIF and Exhibition Viewer
- Installing and using the Exhibition Viewer as an NPM package

## Viewer URLs

Customise the viewer URL by adding parameters to the query string.
