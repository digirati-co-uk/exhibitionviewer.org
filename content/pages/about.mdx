# About the IIIF Exhibition Viewer

Since 2017, when TU Delft celebrated its 175th anniversary, the university has been raising the profile of its [Academic Heritage](https://heritage.tudelft.nl/en) by systematically curating its collections, initiating research projects and organising on-campus presentations in collaboration with students and academic staff. From this project a IIIF-based Exhibition Viewer was built to present on-campus physical Exhibitions in a digital format.

Through collaboration with Digirati, the tools and approach for delivery of these Exhibitions has continued to evolve. In 2024 work started on splitting out this Exhibition Viewer into it's own separate, IIIF Viewer and adding the ability to customise it.  This builds on the previous work by creating a richer fully standalone and embeddable exhibition viewing experience. Both TU Delft and Digirati are keen to expand and develop its potential further, partnering with other collaborators who can benefit from the work that has gone into developing the tool so far. 

Additionally features were added to the Digirati [IIIF Manifest Editor](https://manifest-editor.digirati.services) to support Exhibition Building.
